        <ul>
          <li>MongoDB - MongoDB is a document database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability</li>
          <li>Mongoose - Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to modeling your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.</li>
          <li>Express - Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications</li>
          <li>Angular - AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control as well.</li>
          <li>Node.js - Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices</li>
          <li>Gulp - Gulp is task runner that automates many of the time consuming tasks that you have to do while developing a project. These include tasks such as running tests, concatenating files, minification, and CSS preprocessing. By simply creating a task file, you can instruct the task runner to automatically take care of just about any development task you can think of as you make changes to your files.</li>
